### Game Loop

* Start Screen
  * user navigates to page, sees a title screen and the option to enter a room or create a room
  * enter a room
    * enter room id, enter name
    * if the id is valid and the game in this room has not started yet
      * enters room
    * else
      * error message
  * create a room
    * enter name, enters room
* Room Screen
  * users in room are shown
  * user can set their state to ready
  * users can exit room
  * if enough players are in room, and all players are ready the game starts
* Game
  * Phase 1: trick declaration
    * shown are: current hand, player scoreboard + declared tricks
    * player enter their trick number into prompt wait for all players
  * Phase 2: main round

    * if its their turn, the can select a card and add it to the current trick
  * Phase 3: counting
    * shown are: updated score board
  * End phase
    * winner declaration
    * on exit, go back to room screen
* Chat
  * should be available in room and game

### Technology

* websockets
* enter room + name &rarr; send: NAME, ROOM_ID, retreive: PLAYER_ID (used to perform all subsequent communication)
* general: state is changed via setFunctions, state is broadcasted completely, renderer should change based on state, chat and game should have decoupled states, chat should have a max. state size (e.g. clamp old messages)
* setFunctions that are invalid sould lead to resend of valid state + error message
* each message needs to contain room id and player id for relaying messages
* internally:
  * outer layer: webserver
    * provides frontend as static file serve
    * provides websocket to which the frontend(s) can connect
    * holds all websocket connections
    * if a player connects to a room, checks if a gameserver instance with this id is present, if not, creates one, otherwise relays messages to this server
    * if a player disconnects, announces to server that player is gone (should lead to game reset to room - maybe "rage quit" message)
  * 2nd layer: gameserver
    * 
  * game server: input: functions, output: stateobservable
